However, on the flip side, this growth and development come at the cost of increased energy consumption. The escalating energy consumption negatively impacts the environment by generating carbon dioxide, commonly known as CO2 emissions. It's imperative for nations worldwide to address this issue.

While the USA maintains the highest total CO2 emissions over time, it ranks second in per capita emissions. China and Russia drop out of the top 20 countries in the per capita emissions plot. A surprising observation is that Qatar claims the top spot, despite its population in 2021 being only 2.688 million. Additionally, three other Gulf countries—UAE (9.365 million), Kuwait (4.25 million), and Bahrain (1.463 million)—take positions 4, 5, and 9, respectively, in the per capita emissions ranking.\n\n*Let's analyze the top country for per capita emissions over time.*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"table_data = []\n\nco2_emission_filtered = co2_emission_df[['Country', 'Year', 'Per Capita']][(co2_emission_df['Per Capita'] != 0) & (~co2_emission_df['Country'].isna())]\n\ntop_country_per_capita_year = co2_emission_filtered.groupby('Year').apply(lambda x: x.loc[x['Per Capita'].idxmax()]).reset_index(drop=True)\n\ngrouped_by_country = top_country_per_capita_year.groupby('Country')\n\nfor country, group_df in grouped_by_country:\n    start_year = None\n    prev_year = None\n\n    for index, row in group_df.iterrows():\n        if start_year is None or row['Year'] == prev_year + 1:\n            if start_year is None:\n                start_year = row['Year']\n            prev_year = row['Year']\n        else:\n            table_data.append([country, start_year, prev_year])\n            start_year = row['Year']\n            prev_year = row['Year']\n    \n    table_data.append([country, start_year, prev_year])\n\ntable_df = pd.DataFrame(table_data, columns=['Country', 'Start Year', 'End Year'])\n\ntable_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T18:10:19.058074Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T18:10:19.058512Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T18:10:19.162892Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-29T18:10:19.058475Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-29T18:10:19.161805Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The United Kingdom held the top position for approximately 82 years, from 1820 to 1902.
